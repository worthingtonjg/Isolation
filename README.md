# The Labyrinth of Isolation

This game was made in under 3 hours for TriJam #191.  Can you escape the Labyrinth of Isolation?

## Team:

- Jon Worthington - Game Design / Art / Programming 
- Ryan Worthington - Music Arrangement / Sound Effect

## Developer Notes:

- This is my first 3-hour game jam - normally attend 48-hour jams.
- The labyrinth is dynamically generated each game, but the algorithm is very simplistic.  I randomly place four different tiles in a 10x10 grid (some tiles are less likely to get picked than others - specifically dead ends and intersections are used the least).
- It was a fun challenge to plan and build a game in such a short time frame.  It was challenging to think of an idea that was small enough that it could be accomplished in the short timeframe.
- I kept the art really simple to save time, just used colored cubes.
- I also spent very little time on the UI because I was running out of time.
